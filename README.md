# UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY
This is a group project carried out by myself and group members during our training with Tech4dev. This topic was picked from the SDG goal 1 (No Poverty). The purpose of this project is to delve deep into the causes of poverty in Africa, focusing on variations across West (Nigeria and Sierra Leone) and Eastern (Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique) African regions.

## Introduction
Africa faces the grim reality of being the world’s poorest continent, with over 430 million people living on less than $1.90 per day. Our analysis can contribute to the design of more impactful poverty alleviation programs.

## Countries used 
* Kenya (East Africa)            
* Mozambique (East Africa)
* Nigeria (West Africa)
* Sierra Leone (West Africa)
* Uganda (East Africa)   ![image](https://github.com/EmmanuelBlessing95/UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY/assets/143742946/c9bee6ff-5bf6-4730-a2c4-798a0fe9e400)

## Methodology
* Data Gathering
* Dataset description
* Analysis Tools
* Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Data Modelling
* Data Visualization and Dashboard

### Data Gathering
* World Bank Development Research group
* World Bank account data, and OECD national account data files
* World Bank Staff estimates based on age distribution of United Nations Populations Divisions World Population Prospects:2022 Revisions
* International labour organization “ILO Modelled Estimates and
Projections database (ILOEST)” ILOSTAT

### Dataset Description
A collection of socio-economic and demographic indicators for selected African countries over 10 years. Here is a description of some of the data fields:

* GDP Growth: the annual growth rate of a country's Gross Domestic Product .
* GDP per capita: GDP of a country divided by its total population.
* Income Group: categorizes countries into income groups based on factors like their GDP per capita.
* Dependent old age: percentage of the population that is considered elderly, typically those aged 65 and older.
* Unemployment rate: percentage of the labor force that is currently unemployed.
* Limited access to drinking water: percentage of the population in a country that lacks adequate access to clean
and safe drinking water sources.

### Tools
* Microsoft Excel: Data Exploration, Data Cleaning and Preparation.
* Microsoft Word: Documentation and Reporting.
* Microsoft Power BI: Data Visualization, and dashboard.
* Microsoft Teams: Collaboration, and Sharing Reports.
* Microsoft PowerPoint: Presentation of Findings.
* Microsoft Power Query: Data Transformation.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
* The Data Cleaning process was accomplished with Microsoft Excel and Power Query.
* Refined our datasets by filtering out countries that were not part of the case study.
* Transformed these indicators to their suitable data types.
* Transformed the date column to the appropriate date type.
* Remove duplicated and unnecessary rows and columns.
* Saved all cleaned datasets appropriately.

* Uganda, Mozambique, and Nigeria have the highest working age that is dependent while Kenya has the lowest working age that is dependent.

#### Age Dependency
![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-11 at 15 46 57_c12a3b47](https://github.com/EmmanuelBlessing95/UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY/assets/143742946/dd362188-b25e-4ca7-80d0-fc503178714a)
* Nigeria and Kenya have the highest old-age that are dependent while Uganda has the least old-age that are dependent.
Causes of the high dependency ratio
 Health Issues
 Traditional Family Structures
 Lack of Adequate Healthcare
 Lack of Social Welfare Programs
 Limited Educational Opportunities
 Economic Factors, Social and Cultural Factors

#### Unemployment rate
