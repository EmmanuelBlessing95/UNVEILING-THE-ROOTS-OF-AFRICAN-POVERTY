# UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY
This is a group project carried out by myself and group members during our training with Tech4dev. This topic was picked from the SDG goal 1 (No Poverty). The purpose of this project is to delve deep into the causes of poverty in Africa, focusing on variations across West (Nigeria and Sierra Leone) and Eastern (Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique) African regions.

## Introduction
Africa faces the grim reality of being the world’s poorest continent, with over 430 million people living on less than $1.90 per day. Our analysis can contribute to the design of more impactful poverty alleviation programs.

## Countries used 
* Kenya (East Africa)            
* Mozambique (East Africa)
* Nigeria (West Africa)
* Sierra Leone (West Africa)
* Uganda (East Africa)   ![image](https://github.com/EmmanuelBlessing95/UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY/assets/143742946/c9bee6ff-5bf6-4730-a2c4-798a0fe9e400)

## Income Group

* Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are Low-income countries while Nigeria and Kenya are Lower middleincome countries.
  ### Recommendations
#### Low-Income Countries
* Invest in modernizing the agricultural sector to enhance food security and increase the income of rural populations, who often constitute a significant portion of the poor.
* Promote microfinance and provide support for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) to stimulate entrepreneurship and local economic development.
#### Low middle Income Countries
* Support the growth of manufacturing industries and promote exports to strengthen the international trade position and create more jobs.

## Accountability and Corruption
![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-11 at 20 50 05_56e176b0](https://github.com/EmmanuelBlessing95/UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY/assets/143742946/c4c750c0-651e-4260-8dac-e43136cd63e4)
The corruption index across the selected countries has an average of 3 (middle of the index) signifying that there have been some corrupt practices that have been built and sustained over the years. This implies misallocation of public resources; whereby investments in poverty reduction are delayed or insufficient contributing to the poverty rate.
  ### Recommendations
* Policies and measures should be put in place to ensure that allocated funds for essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure are not diverted for personal gain or channeled into corrupt projects.

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-12 at 01 10 07_6fc2e29c](https://github.com/EmmanuelBlessing95/UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY/assets/143742946/29c16c23-668a-41d8-ac68-4cf710cfbddd)
* There has been a fluctuation in the GDP growth percentage within the years explored. This infers that there was slower economic activity, which can lead to fewer job opportunities and higher employment rate 2020 was a peculiar year as most of the studied countries experienced a negative GDP growth indicating that the total economic output significantly decreased over a specific period, i.e. fewer production of goods and services due to COVID and other global crisis.
* These low GDP growth over the years infers a deterred domestic and foreign investment which in turn leads to economic opportunities being constrained. This hinders the government's ability to invest in and expand access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and clean water. This can disproportionately affect lowincome individuals and communities thus contributing in the poverty rate.
   ### Recommendations
* Government can increase spending on infrastructure projects, education, healthcare, and other public goods and services. This boosts demand in the economy, creates jobs, and stimulates
economic activity.
* Investing in education and skill development programs can improve the quality of the workforce, making it more attractive for businesses to invest and expand in the country

# Conclusion 
* Limited access to clean drinking water & Sanitation
* Limited access to health care facility
* Food scarcity
* High illiteracy rate
* High unemployment rate
* Lack of accountability and
* High rate of corruption
