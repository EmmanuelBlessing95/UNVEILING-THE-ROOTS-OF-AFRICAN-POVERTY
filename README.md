# UNVEILING-THE-ROOTS-OF-AFRICAN-POVERTY
This is a group project carried out by myself and group members during our training with Tech4dev. The purpose of this project is to delve deep into the causes of poverty in Africa, focusing on variations across West (Nigeria and Sierra Leone) and Eastern (Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique) African regions.

## Introduction
Africa faces the grim reality of being the worldâ€™s poorestcontinent, with over 430 million people living on less than $1.90 per day. Our analysis can contribute to the design of more impactful poverty alleviation programs.

## Country used
* Kenya (East Africa)
* Mozambique (East Africa)
* Nigeria (West Africa)
* Sierra Leone (West Africa)
